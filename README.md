# Funnel Pipeline & Sales Conversion Analysis for Saas Tech 

### Executive Summary

<p align ="justify"> Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I analyzed the company’s sales pipeline to identify revenue risks, stage bottlenecks, and activity gaps affecting conversion. The dashboard highlights declining pipeline value, inconsistent sales activity, and delays in key deal stages that limit quota attainment. These insights reveal immediate opportunities to strengthen forecasting accuracy and improve overall sales effectiveness.:</p>

Key areas of improvement:

- Optimize message and workflow touchpoints inside the sales funnel.

- Increase structured follow-up through automated reminders.

- Strengthen client engagement to enhance conversion and reduce lost deals.



### Business Problem

<p align="justify"> Completed orders are essential for this SaaS tech company because they are directly tied to revenue generation. However, stakeholders have identified that the product is experiencing a lower-than-expected conversion rate, particularly between user interaction, login attempts, and final order completion. This gap suggests that a considerable number of users fall out of the workflow before completing the intended process, indicating friction points within the login and verification stages.. </p>

### Methodology 

- Data Extraction: SQL queries to pull pipeline, deal stage, activity, and sales performance records.

- Data Processing: Python (Pandas, Numpy) for cleaning, transformation, and KPI calculations.

- Analytics & Visualization: Power BI for dashboard creation (funnel analysis, stage duration, win rate, activity score).

- Comparative Analysis: YTD trends, variance vs. quota, deal size behavior, agent performance benchmarking.

#### Skills:

- SQL (joins, aggregations, window functions).

- Python (Pandas, ETL, KPI computation).

- Power BI (DAX, relationships, advanced visuals).

- Data Analytics (trend analysis, funnel analytics, churn risk, win–loss analysis).

- Business Intelligence (storytelling, dashboard design, stakeholder communication).

### Results & Business Recommendations:

<p align="justify"> 
Creating a dashboard to analyze Superstore performance gives commercial and executive teams clear visibility into sales, profit, and customer behavior across regions and product categories. By democratizing this data, stakeholders can now self-serve insights, reducing ad-hoc requests by more than 5 hours per week. The analysis revealed strong YoY growth in sales and orders, but a 4.4% decline in profit ratio driven by margin pressure in key categories. Regional performance showed California and New York as primary revenue drivers, while central states lag behind. Forecasting models indicate that increasing sales of top sub-categories by 1% could generate £380–£450 in additional daily revenue, and improving profit ratio by 1% could add roughly £520 per day. </p>

✅ 21.4% YoY growth in total sales and 16% YoY growth in profit.

✅ Most profitable regions: East & West. Highest-revenue state: California (£457.7K).

✅ Top-performing segments: Consumer (45%) and Corporate (33%).

✅ High-performing categories: Technology (£272.4K) and Office Supplies (£253.8K).

✅ Sub-category analysis highlights Phones, Chairs, and Binders as top contributors.

<p align="justify"> 
Because the strongest revenue opportunities come from improving profit ratio, strengthening high-performing categories, and optimizing underperforming regions, I recommend a few strategic adjustments:

Increase targeted promotions in top-performing sub-categories (Phones, Chairs, Binders) to capitalize on high conversion and strong YoY demand.
